# YETI-memes
meme generator for our friends at YETI [YETIzens]

# Why YETI-memes?
Working on the Digital Product team at YETI is a lot of fun and we get to work with a lot of different teams. With that being said, this means we also get to give the best presentations at YETI. So, in order to make sure we stay true to our strong GIF/Meme game, I created YETI-memes.

# So.. what is there to gain from this? 
Besides the obvious clout gained from creating the only meme generator at YETI, it was also a great way to learn [Fabric.js](http://fabricjs.com/), the popular HTML5 canvas library. In the process I got to brush up on just a tiny bit of Node as well. I also wanted to see what it was like to host a Node app without using a framework on the frontend (I love Jquery, what can I say?). All of this to say, this is the most used app I've ever created and the joy it brings me reminds how fun it is to write code.
